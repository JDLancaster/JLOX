```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)   # Load additional packages here
require(dplyr)

# Some customization.  You can alter or delete as desired (if you know what you are doing).
trellis.par.set(theme=theme.mosaic()) # change default color scheme for lattice
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
```

## Using RMarkdown
```{r}
data<-read.table("c62.surinfo.dat")
data<-rename(data,??=V1,state=V5,id=V3,group=V2)
surveydata<-read.table("http://pmatheson.people.amherst.edu/c62.survey.dat")
surveydata<-rename(surveydata,id=V1,Q1=V2,Q2=V3,"P(3a)"=V4,"P(3b)"=V5,"P(3c)"=V6,Q4=V7)
```

### Text

Text can be decorated with **bold** or *italics*.  It is also possible to 

* create [links](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) 
* include mathematics like $e=mc^2$ or 
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$


Be sure to put a space after the * when you are creating bullets and a space after # when 
creating section headers, but **not** between $ and the mathematical formulas.

### Graphics

If the code of an R chunk produces a plot, this plot can be displayed in the resulting file.
```{r}
xyplot(births ~ date, data=Births78)
```

### R output
Other forms of R output are also displayed as they are produced.
```{r}
favstats(~ births, data=Births78)
```

### Destination formats

This file can be knit to HTML, PDF, or Word.  In RStudio, just select the desired output file type
and click on `Knit HTML`, `Knit PDF`, or `Knit Word`.  Use the dropdown menu next to that to 
change the desired file type.

### Documenting file creation 

It's useful to record some information about how your file was created.

  * File creation date: `r Sys.Date()`
  * `r R.version.string`
  * R version (short form): `r getRversion()`
  * `mosaic` package version: `r packageVersion("mosaic")`
  * Additional session information
  
```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()  # could use devtools::session_info() if you prefer that
```
